# wellBowled.ai — Product Spec

## Overview

Two-sided product:
1. **Content (marketing):** Annotated international bowler videos on Instagram/YouTube
2. **Paid comparison ($1):** User uploads clip, gets personalized comparison to international bowler

## Side 1: Content Creation

Annotated videos of international bowlers (Bumrah, Steyn, Starc, Anderson, etc.) with skeleton overlay, phase annotations, angle measurements. Posted on Instagram/YouTube with wellBowled.ai watermark. Drives traffic to the site.

## Side 2: Paid Comparison ($1)

### User Flow

```
1. Land on wellBowled.ai (from social media content)
2. Upload bowling clip (3-10 seconds)
3. Interactive SAM 2 annotation:
   - User clicks on themselves in one frame
   - Green mask grows with each click (real-time feedback)
   - Keep clicking until full body is highlighted
   - "Looks good? → Analyze"
4. SAM 2 propagates masks through all frames (30-60 sec, cloud GPU)
5. MediaPipe extracts pose → angles computed at 5 delivery phases
6. Bowler matching:
   AUTO: system filters → matches → "You're 82% Steyn among right-arm fast bowlers"
   OR MANUAL: user searches by name, picks any bowler
7. Language: English / Tamil / Hindi
8. Pay $1 (Stripe)
9. Receive in <5 minutes:
   - Comparison card image (shareable, 1080x1920)
   - Short annotated video (15-20s)
   - Both watermarked wellBowled.ai
```

### Bowler Matching Logic

**Step 1: Hard filter (eliminate incompatible bowlers)**
```
Filter by bowling arm:    left / right
Filter by action type:    side-on / front-on / sling / round-arm / unique
Filter by pace category:  fast (140+) / medium-fast (130-140) / medium (120-130) / spin
```

**Step 2: Soft match within filtered subset**
```
Compute angle vector per bowler at each phase:
  [front_knee, hip_shoulder_sep, trunk_lean, stride_pct, arm_slot]

Cosine similarity between user's vector and each bowler in filtered subset.
Best match = highest similarity.
```

A left-arm sling bowler is never compared to a right-arm over-the-top bowler. The comparison is always within the same bowling archetype.

**Step 3: Present result**
```
"Among right-arm fast bowlers, you're closest to Dale Steyn (82% match)"
Also show: "65% Bumrah, 58% Starc" as alternatives
User can override: "Compare me to Bumrah instead"
```

### International Bowler Database

Pre-computed once per bowler. Stored as JSON:

```json

Target: 20-30 bowlers covering:
- Right-arm fast (Steyn, Bumrah, Starc, Archer, Rabada)
- Right-arm medium-fast (Anderson, Broad, Hazlewood, McGrath)
- Left-arm fast (Wasim, Boult, Starc, Johnson)
- Left-arm medium (Anderson... wait he's right)
- Sling/round-arm (Malinga, Bumrah's unique)
- Spin (Warne, Murali, Ashwin, Bumrah) — different metrics

### Gemini's Role

One call per analysis for multilingual coaching text:

```
Prompt:
"You are a cricket bowling coach. Given these comparison results:

Bowler: {user_description}
Compared to: {bowler_name} ({match_pct}% match)
Category: {bowling_arm} {action_type} {pace_category}

Angles:
  Front Knee: User {user_knee}° vs {bowler_name} {bowler_knee}°
  Hip-Shoulder: User {user_hss}° vs {bowler_name} {bowler_hss}°
  Trunk Lean: User {user_lean}° vs {bowler_name} {bowler_lean}°
  Stride: User {user_stride}% vs {bowler_name} {bowler_stride}%

Generate a 3-line coaching verdict in {language}.
Line 1: The biggest gap and what it means
Line 2: Why fixing this matters (pace / accuracy / injury)
Line 3: One specific drill or focus to improve

Be specific to these numbers. Not generic advice.
Use cricket terminology appropriate for the language.
Languages: English, Tamil (தமிழ்), Hindi (हिंदी)"
```

### Angles Measured (reliable at 30fps)

| Angle | What it measures | How computed | Reliable? |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Front knee | Brace stiffness at landing | Angle at joint 26 (hip-knee-ankle) | ✓ holds 3-5 frames |
| Hip-shoulder separation | Rotational energy storage | Angle between hip line and shoulder line | ✓ proven in X-Factor |
| Trunk lean | Lateral flexion (injury risk) | Angle from vertical at spine midpoint | ✓ holds several frames |
| Stride length | Delivery stride as % of height | Distance between ankles / torso length | ✓ static measurement |
| Arm slot | Over-the-top vs round-arm | Clock position of wrist relative to shoulder | ⚠ changes fast, measure at arm-over frame |

### Tech Stack

| Component | Tech | Cost |
|-----------|------|------|
| Frontend | Next.js or plain HTML+JS | Free (Vercel) |
| SAM 2 | Replicate API (cloud GPU) | ~$0.05/clip |
| Pose | MediaPipe (server CPU) | Free |
| Coaching text | Gemini Pro | ~$0.01 |
| Payment | Stripe | 30¢ + 2.9% |
| Hosting | Vercel + Railway/Fly.io | ~$10/mo |
| **Total per analysis** | | **~$0.40** |
| **Revenue per analysis** | | **$1.00** |
| **Margin** | | **~60%** |

### Cost Revised (with Stripe)

```
Compute: $0.06
Stripe fee: $0.33 (30¢ + 2.9% of $1)
Hosting amortized: $0.01
Total cost: ~$0.40
Revenue: $1.00
Margin: $0.60 (60%)
```

At 100 analyses/day = $60/day margin = $1800/month.

### MVP Build Order

1. **Bowler database** — process 5 bowlers (Steyn, Bumrah, Starc, Anderson, Malinga), store angle profiles
2. **Comparison engine** — filter → match → generate card image
3. **SAM 2 web UI** — polish the existing bowler_selector/app.py for user self-annotation
4. **Payment** — Stripe integration
5. **Gemini multilingual** — coaching text in 3 languages
6. **Content pipeline** — semi-automated annotation of international bowler clips for social media

### What Already Exists

- SAM 2 web UI (`bowler_selector/app.py`) — working prototype
- MediaPipe pose extraction — working, deterministic (60/60 identical)
- Angle computation — working (hip-shoulder, knee, trunk lean)
- X-Factor pipeline — working (Steyn 47°, Bumrah 41°)
- Video rendering with overlays — working
- Gemini integration — working
- Isolated bowler video — working (SAM 2 large + manual clicks)

### Risks

1. **SAM 2 on diverse user clips** — may fail on poor quality phone footage. Mitigation: user sees the mask and can retry.
2. **Camera angle variation** — user's phone angle vs international bowler's broadcast angle. Mitigation: only compare angles that are stable across angles (hip-shoulder sep is most stable).
3. **MediaPipe accuracy on amateur footage** — lower resolution, unusual clothing. Mitigation: show confidence score, allow re-upload.
4. **Bowler database effort** — processing 20-30 bowlers manually. Mitigation: start with 5, add more over time.
